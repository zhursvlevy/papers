# Papers
In this repository you may see links to my papers. At this moment, i have 3 ones about latent spaces of convolutional neural networks:

- My first step in research. Preliminary analysis of neural network algorithms of one-class classification: [paper](https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=49480829)
- Representation learning. Forming interpretable subspaces of shape and texture of object: [paper](https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=50211030&pff=1)
- Ouf-of-domain detection using interpretable subspaces: [paper](https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=50146148&pff=1)
My applied research:

- Paper accepted for publication. False positive suppression algorithm: [paper](https://github.com/zhursvlevy/papers/blob/main/FPS.pdf)
- LNCS Springer (indexed in scopus): Image Segmentation Algorithms Composition for Obtaining Accurate Masks of Tomato Leaf Instances [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-49435-2_13)
